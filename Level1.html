<h2> Grammar: Mixed Conditionals </h2>
<h4> Mixed Conditionals are a combination of two different conditional types, typically used to talk about hypothetical situations where the time of the condition (the "if" clause) and the result (the main clause) are different. They often involve mixing the second and third conditional structures. </h4>

    <h3>Two common types of mixed conditionals:</h3>

<h4>1. Past condition, present result </h4> 
   <p>This is used when an event in the past influences or affects the present.  </p>
  <p> - Structure: </p> 
    <p> If + past perfect (had + V3), would + base verb.  </p>
  <p> - Example:  </p>
   <p>  If I had studied harder, I would have a better job now.</p>

<h4>2. Present condition, past result </h4> 
   <p>This is used to express how a current situation or state could have changed a past outcome.</p>  
   <p>- Structure:</p>  
     <p>If + past simple (second conditional), would have + past participle (third conditional).</p>  
  <p> - Example:</p>  
     <p>If I were more organized, I would have finished the project on time.</p>

   <h4> Key Point:</h4>
The clauses mix time frames to show a past event affecting the present or a present condition affecting the past.</h4>

<h2> Text </h2>
<BR>If Claire had studied harder in college, she would have <strong>secured</strong> a better job by now. She often thinks about how different her life would be if she hadn't <strong>skipped</strong> so many classes. Her friends who were more <strong>diligent</strong> in their studies are now working in successful companies, and Claire sometimes feels regret. If she had <strong>realized</strong> the importance of education back then, she wouldn’t be <strong>dealing</strong> with financial difficulties today. Instead, she would be enjoying a stable career and higher income.</BR>

<BR>However, Claire understands that it’s not too late to make changes. If she were more <strong>disciplined</strong> now, she could still improve her skills and find a better job in the future. She has already started taking online courses, and if she continues with this dedication, she believes she will have a chance to <strong>advance </strong> in her career. Claire also thinks that if she had saved more money earlier, she wouldn't be struggling to pay for these courses now. But she remains optimistic, knowing that if she keeps working hard, she will succeed eventually.</BR>

<BR>Moreover, Claire reflects on her personal life and relationships. If she hadn't been so <strong>focused</strong> on short-term pleasures, she would have formed stronger connections with her family and friends. Now, she wishes she had spent more time with them when she had the chance. If she had balanced her time better in the past, she wouldn't feel so distant from the people she cares about. Still, Claire knows that if she makes an effort to reconnect with them, she will be able to rebuild those relationships.</BR>

<BR>In terms of health, Claire also regrets her choices. If she had taken care of her body and mind, she wouldn't be <strong>experiencing</strong> such high levels of stress today. She used to neglect regular exercise and a balanced diet, thinking it wasn’t important. Now, she sees that if she had maintained a healthier lifestyle, she would have more energy and mental <strong>clarity</strong>. Claire realizes that if she starts focusing on her well-being now, she will see improvements in the long term.</BR>
